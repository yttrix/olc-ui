// TestWriteSampleLockedSerializesConcurrentWriters is the regression guard for
// issue #95. The server writes bulk data through per-peer pumps while
// writerLoop writes control/keepalive frames, both calling writeSampleLocked
// concurrently. pion's TrackLocalStaticSample.WriteSample is not safe for
// concurrent use: a frame's packetize step and its RTP emit are not atomic, so
// unsynchronized callers interleave packets on the wire and the remote VP8
// reassembler drops the corrupted frames. This test installs a sampleWriter
// that fails if two calls are ever in flight at once, then hammers it from many
// goroutines.
